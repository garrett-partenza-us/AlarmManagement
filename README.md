# AlarmManagement - A deep LSTM Neural Network project for filtering chattering and noisy alarms.

This project aims to filter chattering and noisy alarms for to lessen alarm operator workloads. This is a well researched area of machine learning and seeks to apply conventional techniques and other wellr researched approaches. The dataset used for this project is called the Tennessee Eastman Process Alarm Management Dataset and can be found and downloaded on IEEE DataPortal for all IEEE members. This project is still under early stages of development.
